    <h2>-Hello!-</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is DJ Lim. Welcome to DJ's Space. Since no one uses mySpace anymore, I thought it would be okay to make something called DJ's Space.</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in South Korea, but I came to the states, specifically to Las Vegas, as a foreign exchange student when I was 15 years old. So I claim my American hometown to be Las Vegas. I'm now 24 years old. I have one biological brother, and 5 other siblings from another mother: 3 Vegas brothers, and 2 Vegas sisters. They are from the host family when I was a foreign exchange student, and I've been close to them since I've been here.</p>

    <p>I'm married to my beautiful wife, Liz. Liz and I have been married for about a year now. We love traveling. After doing so many things together, we decided that traveling is our favorite thing to do. This year, we've traveled to Houston, Texas, Seattle, Washington, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, Cozumel and Costa Maya, Mexico. We are planning on going to Banff, British Columbia, Canada in August-September, and South Korea in the late October.</p>

    <p>Besides traveling, I like doing outdoor activities, which is exactly why we travel. I enjoy snowboarding, rock climbing, snorkeling, soccer, hiking, camping, cliff jumping, etc. Sometimes, I'm not quite sure why I'm a software engineering major since I should be sitting in front of my computer, reading, studying, and developing. But I find that if I'm active and doing outdoor things, I feel more refreshed and excited to program when it's time. It helps me become more effective in coding. </p>

	    <p>That's pretty much it about me in a nutshell. I'm excited to get to know more of you through this amazing class, and also to learn more about Web Engineering.</p>
