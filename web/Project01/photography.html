			<h2>Bailee + Zach</h2>

			<p>Bailee and Zach's beautiful engagement pictures were taken right below the summit of Grand Tetons. 
    			It was in the middle of January and there was a lot of snow, it was below zero and freezing but the couple was feeling adventurous
    			and decided to jump right in. Of course, their hands and toes were frozen after but they didn't mind. When we have an adventurous couple
    			like them, it may be a little inconvenient at times but we end up getting the best content out there.</p><br />
			<h2>Alli + Nick</h2>
			<img src="pic1.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic2.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic3.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic4.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic5.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic6.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic7.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic8.jpg" class="imgSource" /><br /><br />
			<p>Alli and Nick have been our friends for quite some time. They have been two of the hardest working people we both know.
    		After graduation, they moved to Dallas, Texas and now they are pregnant with a baby girl. Their pictures were taken in Alpine, UT region
    		deep in the mountains where wildlife was seen. It might have been a little rough for pregnant Alli but she never complained once. 
    		To create a candid style of pictures, we encourage and help our couples behave the same way they behave around each other, especially
    		when they are by themselves. </p><br />
			<h2>Kenzie + Tanner</h2>
			<img src="pic24.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic25.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic26.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic27.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic28.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic29.jpg" class="imgSource" /><br /><br />
			<p>Kenzie and Tanner were one of the most perfect couples that we were lucky to shoot with. They were newly married and very passionate
    		for each other. They were still both in school and Tanner was studying Business Management, and Kenzie was going to Paul Mitchell school
    		to become a hair dresser. It was a snowy day but they didn't mind at all about walking, running and goofying around in the snow.
    		We also shared our "What to wear" guide with them and they wore perfect neutral colors for their pictures.</p><br />
			<h2>Karlee + Hadyn</h2>
			<img src="pic33.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic34.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic35.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic36.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic37.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic38.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic41.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic42.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic43.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic44.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic45.jpg" class="imgSource" />
			<img src="pic46.jpg" class="imgSource" /><br /><br />
			<p>Karlee and Hadyn's engagement session was hands down one of my favorite sessions. We drove about an hour towards Palisades Resorvoir. 
    		This spot was found by Liz and I after long hours of searching for prime locations and it was just perfect for them. 
    		We waited a little bit for the clouds to cast over us and once that much needed shades covered us, It was game over.
    		We ended up giving Karlee and Hadyn over 150 pictures for their engagement session because there were so many good ones.
    		We do not put limits on how many pictures we return to the clients, as long as they turn out good.</p><br />
